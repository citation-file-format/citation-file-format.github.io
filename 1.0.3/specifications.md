abstract:
  The *Citation File Format* (*CFF*) is a human- *and* machine-readable format
  for CITATION files. These files provide citation metadata for (research and
  scientific) software. The format aims to support citation-specific use cases for software
  citation described in {% cite principles %}. CFF is serialized in
  [YAML](http://yaml.org) [1.2](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html), and is
  therefore Unicode-based and cross-language. This specification, together with the
  Unicode standard for characters, aims to provide all the information necessary
  to understand CFF, and to use (i.e., write) and re-use (i.e., read, validate,
  convert from) it. These specifications are maintained openly at
  <https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format>. CFF is a source
  format for [CodeMeta](https://codemeta.github.io/) [JSON](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta/blob/master/codemeta.json) files.

# Introduction

## Status of this document

This document reflects version {{ page.version }} of the *Citation File Format* (CFF)'s
*Core* branch (cf. [Status of the format](#status-of-the-format)).
CFF has been developed in the context of the [*Workshop on Sustainable Software
for Science: Practice and Experiences
(WSSSPE5.1)*](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe5-1/), which was held
on 6 September 2017 in Manchester, UK. More specifically, the constraints for
CFF have been developed in the discussion and speed blogging group "Development
and implementation of a standard format for CITATION files", whose members were
Stephan Druskat (Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany), Neil Chue Hong
(Software Sustainability Institute, University of Edinburgh, UK), Raniere Silva
(Software Sustainability Institute, University of Manchester, UK), Radovan Bast
(University of Tromsø, Norway), Andrew Rowley (University of Manchester, UK),
and Alexander Konovalov (University of St. Andrews, UK).

This version is based partly on the changes introduced during the
[FORCE2017](https://www.force2017.org/) hackathon of the [FORCE11 Software
Citation Implementation Working
Group](https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg) in order to make CFF
crosswalkable in [CodeMeta](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta). It mainly
introduces format modularization, and the final specification of CFF-Core as
the module for providing citation metadata.

Future versions will additionally introduce at least a metadata module to
capture the maximum amount of metadata that can be represented in a CodeMeta
JSON file.

CFF Version {{ page.version }} has been developed by [Stephan Druskat](https://github.com/sdruskat) with contributions from the following.

CFF has been developed to provide a format for `CITATION`
files which could be recommended to readers of the blog post which has been
produced by the group during the workshop and shortly after, and which will be
published on the [blog page](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog) of the [Software
Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/).

## Rationale

The rationale for a standardized, machine- and human-readable format for
`CITATION` files is discussed in more detail in
{% cite standardized-citation-files --style ./_bibliography/apa-text.csl %}.
CFF has been developed to support all citation-specific use cases for the
citation of software, as discussed in
{% cite principles --style ./_bibliography/apa-text.csl %},
and thus promote attribution and credit for software in general, and research
software in particular.

In a blog post {% cite citation-files %}, Robin Wilson has introduced `CITATION`
files as a means to make citation information for software easily accessible.
This accessibility is important, because in order to receive deserved credit for
research software in the academic system - where credit is still mainly measured
based on citations - the citation information for software must be made
visible; Authors will only cite software if the citation information is readily
available, as there is no standard, easily deducible way (yet) to cite software,
such as there is for journals for example.

Some have followed the advice, and have uploaded `CITATION` (or `CITATION.md`,
or `CITATION.txt`) files to the root of the source code repository holding their
software. While this practice has made for a good start, free form `CITATION`
files  are not machine-readable, and machine-readability is a precondition for
re-use of the citation information in different contexts which could further
support a fair distribution of credit for research software.

## Status of the format

CFF-Core has been branched out to address
[issue citation-file-format/citation-file-format#23](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/issues/23).
While an ideal format for software citation would arguably implement transitive
credit {% cite transitive-credit %}, there is no concrete implementation yet
that is available for practical use by software creators. The most concrete
suggestion for an implementation is {% cite transitive-credit-json-ld --style ./_bibliography/apa-text.csl %}, the
application of which, however, seems impractical from a usability point of view
in terms of human-writability. Especially regarding the current state of the
practice of providing citation metadata for software {% cite software-citation-practices %},
it seems that at this point in time, a lower-threshold
approach - in terms of technical complexity - could potentially drive higher participation
in the provision of software citation metadata.

On the other end of the complexity spectrum, free form `CITATION` files as suggested by Robin
Wilson {% cite citation-files %} provide an easy-to-access way of providing citation metadata
for software. However, as these files are not reliably formatted, and thus not
machine-readable, their potential for re-use is rather low. Re-use of software citation metadata, however,
is a key factor in the promotion of software citation along the software citation principles
{% cite principles %}, and ultimately the fair distribution of credit for software in science.

CFF aims to provide a compromise between the ideal state of software
citation, i.e., transitive credit, and the state of the practice, i.e., free form
`CITATION` files.

CFF-Core, in this context, provides an implementation for basic
software citation metadata, so that creators of research software can supply relevant
metadata for citation easily. CFF-Core aims at covering use cases *1 (Use software for a paper)*,
*2 (Use software in/with new software)*, and *15 (Store software entry)* as
defined in the software citation principles paper {% cite principles %}.

CFF-Core can be used as a human-writable source and input format for [CodeMeta](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta) JSON,
which is emerging as the standard format for software metadata.

Further development of CFF will include a CFF-Meta module which will provide a set
of keys to provide more general metadata for research software. CFF-Meta will
implement the complete set of [CodeMeta](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta) keys, and will be usable as an extension
to CFF-Core. For more information, see '[Infrastructure](#infrastructure)'.

## Goals

The goal of CFF is to provide an all-purpose citation format (similar to BibTeX
or RIS), and specifically provide optimized means of citation for software via
the provision of software-specific reference keys and types, e.g., a dedicated
type for source code and one for executables, and a reference key for versions,
cf. [Reference types](#reference-types).

The ultimate goal of CFF as a project is comprehensive uptake and re-use of the
format by Research Software Engineers and software developers as well as by
vendors and services, such as software repositories, reference managers, etc.,
in order to boost the visibility of citation information for research software,
and empower the fair distribution of credit for software development,
maintenance, etc., in academia. This can partly be achieved through CFF's
compatibility with [CodeMeta](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta).

## Concepts

For users of other reference formats, such as BibTeX or RIS, it is important to
note that in CFF, all available keys can be used for all [reference types](#reference-types).
For now, CFF
leaves reasonability of use with format users and providers of tooling, such as
conversion software for CFF and other formats. In other words, the use of keys
should follow common sense. If not, it will confuse the user of the `CITATION`
file, and some of the information will probably be lost in re-use scenarios such
as conversion or display. If you feel that CFF does not offer a solution for
your specific use case, please consider contributing to the format as described
in section [Contributions](#contributions).

Furthermore please note that if a section of a work is referenced, this is not
supported by a dedicated reference type. Instead, the `section` key should be used
within a specific "parent" (i.e., `book` for a section of a book, etc.).

# Format

CFF `CITATION` files must be named `CITATION.cff`.

CFF is implemented in YAML 1.2, as the language provides optimal human-
readability and the required core data types. For details, see the
YAML 1.2 Specifications {% cite yaml-1-2-specs %}.

## Formatting

CFF follows the formatting rules of YAML 1.2, of which one of
the most important ones is that the colon (`:`) after a key should always be
followed by a whitespace.

Structure is determined by indentation, i.e., lines
containing nested elements must be indented by at least one whitespace character,
although using at least two whitespaces as a standard for indentation preserves
readability.

Value strings can (and sometimes should) be double-quoted, e.g. `"string"`,
especially when they contain YAML special characters, or special characters in
general. These include:

> `:  {  }  [  ]  ,  &  *  #  ?  |  -  <  >  =  !  %  @  \`

## File structure

`CITATION.cff` files represent YAML 1.2 dictionaries ("maps") with
the keys listed in the table below. Note that the order of the keys is arbitrary,
and that most YAML [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software))s
will re-order the keys alphabetically.

The primary keys are used to specify

- the version of CFF in use (`cff-version`);
- a message which should be conveyed to the user of the software,
along the lines of "If you use this software, please cite it as follows" (`message`);
- the citation metadata for the software version itself, according to {% cite principles %},
i.e., metadata that can be picked up in a CodeMeta JSON file;
- optionally, a list of references which should be cited in different use cases or scopes, e.g., a software paper describing the abstract concepts of the software (`references`).


### `cff-version` (**required**)

`cff-version` must specify the exact version of the
Citation File Format that is used for the file.

{% highlight yaml %}
cff-version: 1.0.3
{% endhighlight %}

### `message` (**required**)

`message` must specify instructions to users on how
to cite the software the CITATION.cff file is associated
with.

{% highlight yaml %}
message: "Please cite the following works when using this software."
{% endhighlight %}

### Software citation metadata (**required**)

The primary citation metadata provided to users that wish to cite the software
version which the CFF file is for. This metadata can be provided via a subset
of the keys from the table below. The keys follow the basic requirements for
software citation metadata for the three basic use cases, as detailed in
{% cite principles -l 31 --style ./_bibliography/apa-text.csl %} and reproduced
below for convenience.

Provision of the metadata should follow the best
practices detailed in {% cite principles %}, i.e.:

- **Give credit** where credit is due: Make sure that you include every person in the authors list who deserves to be listed as an author. This may include people that have not contributed lines of code, but have contributed as testers, designers, reporters, managers, etc.
- Provide a **unique identifier**: Publish your software version via services that provide it with a DOI, e.g., [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [figshare](https://figshare.com/). This also ensures **accessibility** of the software, as in these cases the unique identifier points to a landing page rather than an actual software product.
- Be **specific** by providing a version number, and citation metadata pertaining to that version. If possible, let your unique identifier point to a software version rather than the "software as such" (all versions of the software). If you want to provide the user with the possibility to cite the software as such in addition to a specific version, create a [reference](TODO) to the software landing page, a software paper, or similar in the CFF file.
If, for some reason, you cannot provide a DOI for your software version, provide the version number or a commit reference (e.g., a Git hash or a Subversion revision number), and a URL to the source code or build artifact repository.
If your software is closed source and you cannot provide a DOI, provide the version number or other version identifier, contact details, and a URL which points to the software landing page, homepage, or similar.

Finally, following the software citation principle of *Persistence*, make sure that the citation metadata persists, even when the software's lifespan is over.

CFF-Core provides the following keys for software citation metadata.

### `references` (**optional**)

Provides an optional list of references pertaining to the software version, or the software itself, e.g., a software paper describing the abstract concepts of the software, a paper describing an algorithm that has been implemented in the software version, etc.

A reference item, i.e., an item in the list under `references`, must at least
specify values for the following mandatory keys: `type`, `authors`, `title`.

`type` must specify the type of the referenced work. For a list of available
values, cf. [reference types](#reference-types).

`authors` must specify a list of [entity](#entity-objects) or [person objects](#person-objects).

`title` must specify the title of the referenced work.

Example:

{% highlight yaml %}
cff-version: 1.0.3
message: "Please cite the following works when using this software."
...
references:
  - type: book
    authors:
      - ...
    title: The science of citation
  - type: software
    authors:
      - ...
    title: Software Citation Tool
{% endhighlight %}


Additionally, it can contain any further [reference keys](#reference-keys). In version
{{ page.version }},
CFF does not specify a strict schema where specific [reference
types](#reference-types) can only contain specific [reference keys](#reference-keys), although this may be
implemented in future versions.

## Reference keys

CFF-Core defines the following reference keys.

### Notable reference keys

**`conference`**, **`database‑provider`**, **`institution`**, **`publisher`**

These keys take an [entity object](#entity-objects) as value. Entity objects
reference named entities and provide a fixed set of keys, such as `name` and
contact information.

Example:

{% highlight yaml %}
references:
  - type: book
    publisher:
      - name: PeerJ
        city: London
        country: GB
        website: https://peerj.com/
{% endhighlight %}

**`authors`**, **`contact`**, **`editors`**, **`editors-series`**, **`recipients`**,
**`senders`**, **`translators`**

These keys take a collection of entity objects or
[person objects](#person-objects) as value. Person objects
provide a fixed set of keys to reference individuals, including a detailed
set for specifiying personal names, an affiliation, etc.

Example:

{% highlight yaml %}
references:
  - type: software
    authors:
      - family-names: Druskat
        given-names: Stephan
        orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4925-7248
        affiliation: "Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin"
        email: "mail@sdruskat.net"
        website: http://sdruskat.net
      - family-names: Beethoven
        name-particle: van
        given-names: Ludwig
      - family-names: Fernández de Córdoba
        given-names: Gonzalo
        name-suffix: Jr.
    ...
{% endhighlight %}

**`type`**, **`languages`**, **`status`**

These keys only take values from a defined set, cf. the respective sections:

- [Reference types](#reference-types)
- [Language strings](#language-strings)
- [Status strings](#status-strings)

**`license‑url`**, **`repository`**, **`repository-code`**, **`repository-artifact`**,
**`url`**

These keys take URL strings as values. URLs will be validated by a regular
expression, such as the one provided in a [GitHub Gist by Diego Perini](https://gist.github.com/dperini/729294).

**`keywords`**

This key takes a collection of strings.

Example:

{% highlight yaml %}
references:
  - type: software
    keywords:
      - linguistics
      - "multi-layer annotation"
      - web service
    ...
{% endhighlight %}


**`scope`**

A reference item can specify a more detailed scope for the reference, via the
reference key `scope`. This key can be useful if certain references should only
be cited under specific circumstances, e.g., only when a specific package
of the software is used. In such a case, the package would ideally have its own
CFF file, but if this is not possible for whatever reason, the `scope` key
may come in handy.

For a discussion of this key, cf. [issue citation-file-format/citation-file-format#15](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/issues/15).

Example:

{% highlight yaml %}
references:
  - scope: "Cite this paper when you run software X with flag --xy"
    type: article
    ...
{% endhighlight %}

**`issue-date`**

Specify the date of release of an issue. This key has been left as a plain
string, rather than a formal date type, to allow for text values such as
"November-December 2018".

For a discussion of this key, cf. [issue citation-file-format/citation-file-format#48](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/issues/48).

# Objects

## Entity objects

Entity objects can represent different types of entities, e.g.,
a publishing company, or conference. In CFF, they are realized as collections with
a defined set of keys. Only the key `name` is mandatory.

| Entity key   | Entity Data Type     | optional |
| -            | -                    | :-:      |
| `name`       | String               |          |
| `address`    | String               | ●        |
| `city`       | String               | ●        |
| `region`     | String               | ●        |
| `post-code`  | String               | ●        |
| `country`    | String               | ●        |
| `orcid`      | String (*ORCID URL*) | ●        |

## Person objects

A person object represents a person. In CFF, person objects are realized as
collections with a defined set of keys, of which only `family-names` and
`given-names` are mandatory.

| Entity key      | Entity Data Type     | optional       |
| -               | -                    | :------------: |

### Exemplary uses

**Name keys**

CFF aims to implement a culturally neutral model for personal names,
according to the
[suggestions on splitting personal names by the W3C](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names)
and the implementation of personal name splitting in
BibTeX {% cite names-in-bibtex %}.

To this end, CFF provides four generic keys to specify personal names:


1. Values for `family-names` specify family names, including combinations of given and
patronymic forms, such as *Guðmundsdóttir* or *bin Osman*; double names with or
without hyphen, such as *Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger* or *Sánchez Vicario*. It
can potentially also specify names that include prepositions or (nobiliary)
particles, especially if they occur in between family names such as in Spanish-
or Portuguese-origin names, such as *Fernández de Córdoba*.
2. Values for `given-names` specify given and any other names.
3. Values for `name-particle` specify nobiliary particles and prepositions, such as in
Ludwig *van* Beethoven or Rafael *van der* Vaart.
4. Values for `name-suffix` specify suffixes such as *Jr.* or *III* (as in
[Frank Edwin Wright *III*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%C3%A9_Cool)).

Note that these keys may still not be optimal for, e.g., Icelandic names which
do not have the concept of family names, or Chinese generation names, but the
alternative is highly localized customization, which would be counterintuitive
as to CFF's goal to be easily accessible. Thus, it is ultimately the task of CFF
file authors to find the optimal name split in any given case.

**`affiliation`**

- To specify the affiliation of a person, e.g., a university, research centre, etc.

**Address keys**

- Cf. [Entity objects](#entity-objects) for details.

**`orcid`**

- Cf. [Entity objects](#entity-objects) for details.

# Specified value strings

The keys `status`, `license`, and `languages` can only take values
from a fixed set of strings. These are specified below.

## Status strings

Works can have a different status of publication, e.g., journal papers. CFF
specifies the following value strings for the key `status`.

  | Status (String)  |                                     Description                                      |
  |------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `in-preparation` | A work in preparation, e.g., a manuscript (covers drafts)                            |
  | `abstract`       | The abstract of a work                                                               |
  | `submitted`      | A work that has been submitted for publication                                       |
  | `in-press`       | A work that has been accepted for publication but has not yet been published         |
  | `advance-online` | A work that has been published online in advance of publication in the target medium |
  | `preprint`       | A work that has been published as a preprint before peer review                      |

Table: Defined statuses for works.
{: .text-right}

For a work that is complete and has been published, leave `status` unset.

## License strings

License strings must conform with the [SPDX Licenses
list](https://spdx.org/licenses/), i.e., a license must be specified via the
short identifier from the list. If a license is not included in the SPDX
Licenses list, the `license-url` should be provided as a fallback.

Example:

{% highlight yaml %}
references:
  - type: software
    authors:
      - ...
    title: My Research Tool
    license: Apache-2.0
  - type: software
    authors:
      - ...
    title: Obscure Research Tool
    license-url: http://r3s34archs0ft.com/eula
{% endhighlight %}

## Language strings

Natural languages as a value for the key `languages` are specified via their
respective 3-character [ISO 639-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3) code. A list
of ISO 639-3 codes in maintained at
[Wikipedia:List of ISO 639-3 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes).
Alternatively, a language's 2-character
[ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) code may be used. A list
of ISO 639-1 codes is maintained at
[Wikipedia:List of ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

Example for a work in both English and Daakaka:

{% highlight yaml %}
references:
  - type: book
    ...
    languages:
      - en
      - bpa
{% endhighlight %}

# Schema

CFF `CITATION.cff` files can be validated against a schema which is available at
<https://github.com/citation-file-format/schema>.

# Examples

All of the following examples are minimal working examples, so they can be copied
and pasted into a `CITATION.cff` file and will validate against the
[CFF schema](#schema).

## Software examples

The main focus of CFF-Core is to comprehensively cover the provision of
citation metadata for software. To this end, use of CFF-Core should - wherever possible - be based on
the Software Citation Principles {% cite principles %}. Scenarios for
software citation are listed below. These are not intended to be comphrensive, but rather to represent both typical and edge cases for software citation.

The following sections list recommendations for producing CITATION files in various circumstances.
In particular, if a DOI is available this information should be included.  A DOI is not required, 
however, since one may not have been registered for the version of the software in question.  In this 
case, as much information to specify the precise version of the software and how it can be obtained
should be given.

### Software with a DOI

Note that {% cite principles -l 12 --style ./_bibliography/apa-text.csl %} recommend

> [...] the use of DOIs as the unique identifier due to their common usage and
acceptance, particularly as they are the standard for other digital products
such as publications.

Furthermore, DOIs should point to a "unique, specific software version"
{% cite principles -l 12 %}. Also it is recommended {% cite principles -l 13 %} that:

> the [DOI] should resolve to a persistent landing page that contains metadata
and a link to the software itself, rather than directly to the source code files,
repository, or executable.

Therefore, a minimal `CITATION.cff` file in such a case would look similar to
the following.

{% highlight yaml %}
cff-version: 1.0.3
message: If you use this software, please cite it as below.
authors:
  - family-names: Druskat
    given-names: Stephan
    orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4925-7248
title: My Research Tool
version: 1.0.4
doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1234
date-released: 2017-12-18
{% endhighlight %}

A more comprehensive version could look similar to the following.

{% highlight yaml %}
cff-version: 1.0.3
message: If you use this software, please cite it as below.

{% endhighlight %}

### Source code without a DOI

We recognize that there are certain situations where it may not be possible to
follow the recommended best-practice. For example, if (1) the software authors
did not register a DOI and/or release a specific version, or (2) the version of
the software used does not match what is available to cite. In those cases,
falling back on a combination of the repository URL and version number/commit
hash would be an appropriate way to cite the software used. {% cite principles -l 12 %}

{% highlight yaml %}
cff-version: 1.0.3
message: "If you use this MRT alpha snapshot version, please cite."
authors:
  - family-names: Druskat
    given-names: Stephan
    orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4925-7248
title: My Research Tool Prototype
version: 0.0.1-alpha1-build1507284872
date-released: 2017-12-18
repository-code: https://github.com/doe/mrt
commit: 160d54f9e935c914df38c1ffda752112b5c979a8
{% endhighlight %}

### Closed-source software without a DOI

For software without a DOI, it is recommended that "the metadata should still
provide information on how to access the specific software, but this may be a
company’s product number or a link to a website that allows the software be
purchased." {% cite principles -l 13 %}. Furthermore, "if the version number and
release date are not available, the download date can be used. Similarly, the
contact name/email is an alternative to the location/repository."
{% cite principles -l 7 %}

Hence, for closed-source software without a DOI for which the version number
and release date cannot be determined, a `CITATION.cff` file could look like
this.
